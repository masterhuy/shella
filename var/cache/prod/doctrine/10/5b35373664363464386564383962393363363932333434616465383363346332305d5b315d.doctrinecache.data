NS8 Protect not only scores all traffic visiting your store, but it also detects and records the traffic&rsquo;s source. You will see when, and which, advertising sources are delivering low-quality, high-risk, fraudulent traffic. You will be able to save money and increase revenue by eliminating poorly performing campaigns and focusing your budget on the successful campaigns that deliver results.<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Compare scored campaigns for the presence of bot traffic and fraud.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Prevent bots and fraudulent users from being tagged for remarketing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Integrate with Google Analytics to tag high-value users for more effective remarketing.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Track your store&rsquo;s advertising savings from blocked fraudulent users.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div><strong>Revenue Killer #3: Poor Performance<\/strong><\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;<\/div>\r\n\r\n<div>NS8 Protect includes 5 critical monitors that every PrestaShop store should have.
